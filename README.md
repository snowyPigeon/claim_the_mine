# claim_the_mine
Game inspired by the mine claiming activity in the original Shadowbane MMORPG.

Written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The original web page written in 2011 provided a choice of three characters to play as: a male warrior, a male scout or a female mage. On commencement the game starts counting down and the player can click a damage button labelled 'd' to take down the defence tower, and then click a prospecting button labelled 'p' hopefully before the timer is up. Graphics were static cartoon images which changed in response to key presses or the timer reaching zero seconds.

Some of the original images appear to be missing, so this project will rework the original code and include new images.
